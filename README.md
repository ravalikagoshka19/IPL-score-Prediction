IPL Score Prediction using Deep Learning
This project aims to develop a deep learning model to predict the first innings score of Indian Premier League (IPL) matches. The model will be trained on historical match data and evaluated on its ability to accurately predict the score of unseen matches.

Project Overview
Objective: Develop a deep learning model to predict the first innings score of IPL matches.
Dataset: Historical IPL match data, including match information, batting and bowling statistics, and team performance metrics.
Methodology: Utilize a deep learning architecture, such as a recurrent neural network (RNN) or long short-term memory (LSTM) network, to capture the temporal dependencies in match data.
Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE).
